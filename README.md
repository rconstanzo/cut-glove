Cut Glove by Rodrigo Constanzo
==================================

The Cut Glove is a live sampling and performance instrument built using Max. It was programmed around the Xbox 360 controller. Additionally, the patch has MIDI learn functionality built in, so every parameter can be mapped to any MIDI controller.
